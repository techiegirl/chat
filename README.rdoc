This is a simple chat api which allows a user to post message to another user by giving user's email, the message body and the sender's id.
Example curl request:

* curl -v -H "Content-Type:application/json" -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/v1/chat/post_message -d '{"sender_id":"2", "receiver_email":"abc@example.com", "message_body":"This is Example"}'

If the user is not found in the system a '500' status error will be returned.
